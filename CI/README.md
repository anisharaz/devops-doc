# Continuous integration means to automatically test your code thought different checks and automatically integrate it if everything is fine

The test can check the following:

- run the code to check if it works
- check the code for linting and formatting issues
- check the code for security issues
- check the code for code style issues
- .... more

manually testing and integration takes time. Automating this process saves time and ensures that the code is always in a good state. And this is called continuous integration.

## Tools

- .... it depends on which language you use. Generally it can include:
- linters like pylint, eslint, etc.
- formatters like prettier, Black, etc.
- unit tests like pytest, unittest, Jest, etc.
- security scanners like bandit, eslint-plugin-security, etc.

## CI is all about automating the process of testing and integrating code changes.
