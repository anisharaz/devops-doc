# Continous Deployment (CD)
CD is the process of deploying the code to the production server automatically. This is done by the CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline is triggered when the code is pushed to the repository. The pipeline will build the code, run the tests, and deploy the code to the production server. This process is automated and reduces the manual intervention required to deploy the code to the production server. This ensures that the code is deployed to the production server quickly and efficiently.

The CD pipelines are configured using tools like Jenkins,Github Actions,Gitlab CI/CD, etc. These tools provide a way to define the pipeline stages and steps required to deploy the code to the production server. The pipeline can be configured to run the tests, build the code, and deploy the code to the production server.
